# Distribution Preserving Multiple Hypothesis Prediction (dpmhp)
This Repository contains the Python Code for the **Distribution Preserving Multiple Hypotheses Prediction (DPMHP)** approach described in the Paper ["Distribution Preserving Multiple Hypotheses Prediction for Uncertainty Modeling"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02858) by Tobias Leemann, Moritz Sackmann, JÃ¶rn Thielecke and Ulrich Hofmann, published at the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks (ESANN) 2021.

The code is a standalone Jupyter Notebook (DistributionPreservingMHP.ipynb), with precomputed models in the ``/data`` folder.
